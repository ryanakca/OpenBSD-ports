Puppet is configured in an agent-server architecture, in which a primary
server node manages the configuration information for a fleet of agent
nodes. Puppet Server acts as the primary server node. Puppet Server is a
Ruby and Clojure application that runs on the Java Virtual Machine
(JVM). Puppet Server runs Ruby code for compiling Puppet catalogs and
for serving files in several JRuby interpreters. It also provides a
certificate authority through Clojure.
