Urlscan is a small program that is designed to integrate with the "mutt"
mailreader to allow you to easily launch a Web browser for URLs contained in
email messages. It is a replacement for the "urlview" program.

Urlscan parses an email message or file and scans it for URLs and email
addresses. It then displays the URLs and their context within the message, and
allows you to choose one or more URLs to send to your Web browser.
Alternatively, it send a list of all URLs to stdout.
