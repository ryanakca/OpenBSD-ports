AFL++ is a fuzzing framework which includes the following:

- A fuzzer with many mutators and configurations: afl-fuzz.
- Different source code instrumentation modules:
  LLVM mode, afl-as, GCC plugin.
- Different binary code instrumentation modules:
  QEMU mode, Unicorn mode, QBDI mode.
- Utilities for testcase/corpus minimization: afl-tmin, afl-cmin.
- Helper libraries: libtokencap, libdislocator, libcompcov.

It is a superior fork of Google's AFL - more speed, more and better
mutations, more and better instrumentation, custom module support, etc.
