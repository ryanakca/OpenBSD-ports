pax-utils is a small set of utilities for peforming Q/A (mostly security)
checks on systems (most notably, `scanelf`).  It is focused on the ELF
format, but does include a Mach-O helper too for OS X systems.

While heavily integrated into Gentoo's build system, it can be used on any
distro as it is a generic toolset.

Originally focused only on PaX, it has been expanded to be generally
security focused.  It still has a good number of PaX helpers for people
interested in that.
